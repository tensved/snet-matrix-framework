# Overview

Our bot acts as a bridge, allowing users to access services from the SingularityNET marketplace directly through chat.

The key features of the service include:

* **Bot Integration with Matrix Synapse**\
  **T**he bot is easily deployed within a Matrix Synapse server, allowing users to interact with it as they would with any other contact in the messenger. The bot can be invited to rooms or private chats to facilitate snet service requests.
* **Access to SingularityNET Marketplace**\
  **S**ingularityNET is a decentralized marketplace for AI services. Through the bot, users can browse, request, and interact with services from this marketplace using simple chat commands.
* **Service Call Workflow**\
  Once a user requests a service, the bot handles the entire process â€” from capturing input parameters to executing the chosen snet method and returning the result. The bot simplifies the interaction by prompting the user for each required input one by one, making complex snet services accessible to everyone.
* **Built-in Payment System**\
  **T**he bot includes integrated payment tools. When a service is requested, the bot generates a payment link. Once the user completes the payment, the bot continues with the service call, ensuring that the transaction is smooth and secure.
