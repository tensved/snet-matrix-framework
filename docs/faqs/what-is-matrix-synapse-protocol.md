# What is Matrix (Synapse) Protocol?

**Matrix** is a **federated protocol** for real-time communication, allowing users to send text messages, make voice and video calls, and share files within a decentralized network. A key advantage of Matrix is that anyone can run their own server and be part of the global network, all while maintaining full control over their data.

**Synapse** is a **server implementation of the Matrix protocol**. It allows you to deploy a self-hosted platform for data exchange via Matrix. This means you can create your own decentralized infrastructure for communication that can integrate with other Matrix servers worldwide or be used in a fully private mode.
